## Abstract

This document proposes a speculative hypothesis that reinterprets black holes as dynamic information-energy interfaces. Rather than purely gravitational endpoints, black holes are conceptualized as dual-purpose systems: absorbing structured matter (as information) and gradually re-emitting simplified, high-entropy energy via Hawking radiation. This hypothesis frames black holes as finite-lifetime information-energy converters that maintain universal energy flow and structural balance across the simulated environment of our physical universe.

## 1. Introduction

In current theoretical physics, black holes are often framed as regions of extreme curvature, information paradoxes, and quantum-gravitational breakdown. While Hawking's radiation theory bridges thermodynamics and quantum fields, it remains unclear how infalling matter-information is encoded or released. This paper hypothesizes that black holes are not static dead-ends, but rather **energy-conversion ports** that help regulate cosmic entropy and feed systemic energy cycles.

## 2. Conceptual Framework

### 2.1 Infalling Matter as Information

All physical matter may be viewed as carriers of information—quantum configurations, entropy packets, or compressed structure. When matter enters a black hole, it effectively exits observable space, increasing the black hole's entropy.

### 2.2 Re-Emission via Hawking Radiation

Hawking radiation presents a slow, thermal leak of energy, where black holes dissipate their mass over cosmological timescales. In this model, Hawking radiation is not just random emission—it is the **high-entropy exhaust** of a black hole's internal processing, converting structured information into usable universal energy.

### 2.3 Bidirectional Interface Model

We propose black holes act as **bidirectional information-energy ports**:

- **Input:** Gravitational capture of matter/information
- **Process:** Internal entropy consolidation
- **Output:** Thermal radiation (high-entropy, low-information energy)

This mechanism mirrors a charge-discharge system—an interface absorbing low-entropy structure and discharging generalized energy back into the environment.

## 3. Lifetime and Conversion Limits

### 3.1 Finite Lifespan

A black hole's Hawking radiation implies a natural lifespan—the point at which all stored mass-energy has been radiated away. This lifetime can be interpreted as the total **processing capacity** of the interface.

### 3.2 Interface Saturation and Death

Once the black hole has exhausted its storage, the interface effectively closes. No further conversion or transmission occurs. Like a burned-out circuit, the system completes its entropy transformation and is reabsorbed into universal background energy.

## 4. Energy-Information Equivalence

In this model, **information and energy are interchangeable** under extreme gravitational and quantum conditions. Structured matter encodes low-entropy forms, which—upon black hole ingestion—are gradually decohered into pure thermodynamic noise. Black holes thus enable a deep equivalence: 

> **Information → Energy → Universal Entropy Flow**

---

## 5. Conclusion

We propose that black holes function as **information-energy converters** that both process and redistribute cosmic structure. Far from being one-way erasers of data, they may represent the universe’s **entropy regulators**—absorbing ordered systems and slowly returning their energetic residues back into circulation.

This model is speculative, but offers an alternative lens for reinterpreting black holes as active participants in the universe's computational and energetic metabolism.

## Notes

- This hypothesis remains a conceptual model.
- Further theoretical development would require integration with quantum gravity and cosmological simulations.
- Observational validation is currently beyond current technological reach.
